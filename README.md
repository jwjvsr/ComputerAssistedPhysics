# ComputerAssistedPhysics
This is a set of worksheets that are used in the Applied Physics programme to support the learning of conceptual difficult subjects in physics. 
The set of files form a course on its own. 

Here I keep the adjustments to the Workshop files.

The structure of the repository consists of four main parts, related to the quartiles in which the material is used. 

## Doc
Contains a presentation on the embedding of CAS in the Applied Physics curriculum.

## Main parts:
